# D3 Dashboard (Belly Button Biodiversity) Challenge

This project is an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset using the D3 library in JavaScript. The dashboard includes a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and sample metadata display. The goal is to update all the plots and metadata when a new sample is selected.

## Overview

The D3 Dashboard (Belly Button Biodiversity) challenge demonstrates the use of D3.js, JavaScript, HTML, and Plotly to create an interactive data visualization dashboard. The dashboard features the following components:

- Horizontal bar chart: Displays the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) found in an individual's belly button. The chart uses sample values as the bar heights, OTU IDs as labels, and OTU labels as hovertext.
- Bubble chart: Shows each sample as a bubble, where the x-axis represents OTU IDs, the y-axis represents sample values, and the bubble size and color represent sample values and OTU IDs, respectively. The bubble text displays OTU labels.
- Sample metadata display: Presents demographic information about the selected individual.
- Dropdown menu: Allows users to select a specific sample and update the plots and metadata accordingly.

## Technical Skills

To successfully complete this project, you will need the following technical skills:

- D3 library: Use D3.js to manipulate and visualize data.
- JavaScript: Write JavaScript code to create interactive features and handle data.
- HTML: Structure the web page using HTML.
- Plotly: Use Plotly.js library to create charts.

## Project Parameters

To complete the D3 Dashboard (Belly Button Biodiversity) challenge, you need to fulfill the following requirements:

1. Use the D3 library to read in a JSON file from a specified URL.
2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in an individual:
   - Use `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.
   - Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.
   - Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.
3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample:
   - Use `otu_ids` for the x-values.
   - Use `sample_values` for the y-values.
   - Use `sample_values` for the marker size.
   - Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.
   - Use `otu_labels` for the text values.
4. Display the sample metadata, including demographic information.
5. Update all the plots when a new sample is selected.
6. Deploy the app to a free static page hosting service like GitHub Pages.
